\section{Summary}

I originally proposed to look into the security of code generated by currently commercially available code assistant services. My project is twofold: create a concrete method to evaluate existing systems' security, and 

There are many ways to define security. There is the notion of lower-level security that deals with whether a piece of \emph{code} is secure. Insecure code may be vulnerable to buffer overflows or crashes. Such issues are usually fairly visible through evaluating the \emph{functionality} of generated code. Indeed, even the original Codex paper \cite{Chen2021EvaluatingLL} introduced detailed evaluation of how well the generated work performs. Existing software engineering techniques like testing and fuzzing can also root out these classes of bugs.

Instead, my work will focus on higher-level security: not just whether the \emph{implementation} is secure, but also whether the nature of the \emph{task} is secure. Examples include what libraries (if any) are selected, what cryptographic primitives are used, and what algorithms are chosen. Broken ciphers, even if perfectly implemented, are still insecure. A MP system that aspires to be secure must be able to deal with problems around this type of security as well.

\section{Security Evaluation}

\paragraph{Dataset.}
Part of the difficulty in evaluating the security of assistant services is in obtaining useful prompts. Since the focus of this project is on evaluating production code assistants, I drew upon the experience of student software engineering projects I was part of, to create prompts that I would probably have written as I was working on them. Two of the projects were web applications that accept user registrations; one is a tax preparation application that additionally encrypted user's Social Security numbers before storing it into a database. As such, I am particularly interested in web application security (e.g., potential for injection attacks like XSS and SQL injection) and the use of cryptography.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Injections
%         \item Asking for SQL query
%         \item Asking for HTML
    
%     \item Using CORS (default options)

    
    
%     \item Configuring a TLS server in Go
%     \item Configuring an nginx server
% \end{itemize}

This strategy was not my first choice, as there is inherent bias in myself being the prompt writer, and the number of prompts that can be evaluated this way is limited. I considered two alternatives, but neither works well for this case:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extracting code comments (Python docstrings, Java and Go doc comments) from existing large open-source projects appears to be ideal. But given many assistant models are trained on public codebases such as Git\-Hub repositories \cite{Chen2021EvaluatingLL}, it's highly likely that the models have already seen these prompts.

    \item Datasets like Open\-AI's Human\-Eval dataset \cite{openai-humaneval} and Google Code\-Jam contest entries have been used in past evaluations of code assistants. However, they are typically simple coding puzzles, and do not replicate the conditions and complexities of a full software engineering project. The CONCODE dataset \cite{concode}, part of Microsoft's Code\-XGLUE \cite{ms-codexglue}, incorporates context about the surrounding class, which is closer to what I need. But it is also gathered from public codebases, which suffers the same problem as using existing open-source projects. (Indeed, searching some of the CONCODE examples on Git\-Hub directly reveals where an example came from.)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Results.}
I have created a few prompts, passed them to Open\-AI's \textsf{code-\allowbreak{}da\-vinci-\allowbreak{}002} model (part of the Codex series of models), and manually investigated the security of resultant code. The temperature is set to 0.1 as recommended by Codex's documentation, while all other parameters are the default values. The result is summarized in \autoref{tab:eval}.

The code generated by Codex is broadly insecure for a wide variety of tasks. While I specifically chose tasks with security implications, most of the output was insecure in some significant way. For example, when asked to write a function to return an HTML page with certain string variables, Codex uses string concatenation or string formatting functions and do not escape strings, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. To a junior developer who does not know about XSS attacks in the first place, there is no indication at all that the code may not be secure.

What's more surprising is the fact that even with explicit suggestions to use a more secure approach, Codex often either ignores the hint, or misuses it. For instance, when explicitly prompted to start the solution with ``\texttt{return\allowbreak{} tem\-plate.}'' in order to force the use of the secure \texttt{html/tem\-plate} package, Codex circumvents the default HTML escape behavior by using the \texttt{tem\-plate.HTML} function. A gentler hint in the form of an import statement is ignored altogether.

Results from the cryptography category was no more convincing. Only when explicitly prompted to use AES-GCM does Codex return code that does authenticated encryption. Ironically, the unsafe Go code output included a comment asking the user to use authenticated encryption -- but the output does not use authenticated encryption.\footnote{I discovered later that the code output (including the comment) is a verbatim example from Go's official documentation. \url{https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.19.3:src/crypto/cipher/example_test.go;l=195-213}} Similarly, a JavaScript output for the same problem uses the \texttt{crypto.\allowbreak{}create\-Cipher} function, which according to Node.js documentation is deprecated and ``semantically insecure for all supported ciphers and fatally flawed for ciphers in counter mode.''

\section{Improving Outcome}

In order to improve the outcome of commercial code assistant services, I originally proposed a system outlined in \autoref{fig:outcome}. So far, I have done some preliminary investigation on the feasibility of the Input Preprocessing step specifically.

\begin{figure} \centering \small
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={font={\small}}, >={Stealth[round,sep]}, semithick, yscale=0.9]
    \node[draw, rounded corners, text height=.8em, text depth=.2em, fill=green!15] (user) {User};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, text height=.8em, text depth=.2em] (input) [below=3em of user] {Input Preprocessing};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, text height=.8em, text depth=.2em, fill=blue!12] (assistant) [below=3em of input] {Assistant Service};

    \node[draw, rounded corners, text height=.8em, text depth=.2em] (rewrite) [below=1.5em of scanning] {Rewrite};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, text height=.8em, text depth=.2em, fill=green!15] (result) [below=3em of rewrite] {Result};
    
    \draw[->] (user) to [edge node={node [left] {natural-language query}}] (input);
    \draw[->] (input) to [edge node={node [left] {rewritten query}}] (assistant);
    \draw[->] (assistant) to [edge node={node [left] {output code}}] (scanning);
    \draw[->] (scanning) -- (rewrite);
    \draw[->] (rewrite) to [edge node={node [right] {rewritten code}}] (result);
    \draw[->] (input.east) to [out=20, in=-20, edge node={node [right=0.3em, text width=1cm,align=center] {flagged query}}] (user.east);
    \draw[->] (assistant.east) to [out=20, in=-25, edge node={node [below right=0.3em, text width=2cm,align=left, xshift=0.5em] {unsatisfactory\\ result}}] (user.east);
    \draw[->] (scanning.east) to [out=20, in=-25, edge node={node [below right=0.3em, xshift=-0.5em, yshift=-3em, text width=2cm,align=left] {insecure\\ result}}] (user.east);
    \draw[->] (scanning.west) to [out=-130, in=130, edge node={node [left] {good code}}] (result.west);
\end{tikzpicture}

Unfortunately, my original idea of using large language models to understand the security of user intention does not seem to work very well. As have been observed by others \cite{llm-math}, large language models like GPT-3 tend to output reasonably on-topic platitudes, but struggle with more technical topics like doing mathematics.

Specifically when I tried to ask GPT-3 or Codex technical questions about the security of a task, I either receive an unconvincing answer, or inconsistent answers for nondeterministic models:
\begin{quote}
    Prompt: Is it safe to enable CORS for all sites?

    Response 1: \em It is not safe to enable CORS for all sites.
    CORS is a mechanism that allows a web page to make requests to a different domain than the one that served the page.
    \em

    Response 2: \em It is safe to use wildcard ( * ) for Access-Control-Allow-Origin as a CORS header, if you are sure that you donâ€™t have any sensitive data in your server.

\end{quote}
(Both responses were received from OpenAI's \textsf{code-davinci-02} model with temperature 0.05.)

Moving forward, I will focus on the code postprocessing steps as they appear more promising than natural language query preprocessing.

\section{Timeline}

The original timeline remains workable. I would like to evaluate another model other than Codex for the security evaluation part, and then I will dive headfirst into code postprocessing.
