\begin{abstract}
    Since the release of the Open\-AI Codex system in 2021 \cite{Chen2021EvaluatingLL}, there has been a significant increase in interest into using large machine learning (ML) models as programming aids. Commercial products backed by major corporations have made these models accessible to most individual developers. However, the security of synthesized code is unclear. This work first quantifies the security and quality of a few of these systems over a range of potential inputs. It then proposes the use of input preprocessing, output scanning, and rules-based output rewriting as techniques in an overall system to improve the outcome of using code assistants.

\section{Introduction}

% \sloppy
With the ongoing success of modern machine learning (ML), the idea of using ML techniques to improve software developer productivity has been circulated in both academia and industry \cite{pillars}. One area that has received particular attention is using ML to help write code faster through code assistant plugins in IDEs. Early approaches including rules-based and statistical predictions of the next few tokens after the text cursor \cite{kite-providers}, which are able to complete the current line or function call.

The Codex system released in 2021 \cite{Chen2021EvaluatingLL} went one step further: by evaluating large language models (LLMs) on code, one can complete not just the next few words, but entire functions with high degrees of accuracy. The concurrent introduction of commercial code assistant services based on LLMs, such as Git\-Hub Copilot \cite{copilot-announce} and Amazon Code\-Whis\-per\-er \cite{codewhisperer-announce-science}, further made these tools available to ordinary software developers, triggering a large increase in interest.

Yet, the security of code synthesized by LLMs and LLM-based services is hardly a guarantee. From available documentation, most popular code LLMs are trained on a large volume of publicly available source code, with little to no filtering for code quality. Indeed, a recent Code\-Whis\-per\-er announcement \cite{codewhisperer-announce-science} acknowledges training data quality as a problem, and specifically advertises that it ``help[s] remove security vulnerabilities in a developer's entire project,'' but offers no evidence for the effectiveness of such efforts.

This work has two major goals. First, to improve our understanding of security vulnerabilities that may result from using AI code assistants. Second, to institute a framework for improving the outcome of AI code assistants. With the understanding that ``security'' is a murky term that invites different interpretations, it is likely impossible to either evaluate or improve security to the satisfaction of all. My hope is for this work to be a stepping stone for more sophisticated techniques in the future.

\Cref{sec:prior} reviews previous literature on code assistant security and automated security remediation systems. In \cref{sec:model}, we will concretely define a security model relevant to code assistants. \Cref{sec:eval} includes the methodology and results of an evaluation of two state-of-the-art LLM-based code assistants. \Cref{sec:improve} includes an approach that tries to address weaknesses of code assistants through both automated rewrites and UI improvements. \Cref{sec:future} mentions directions for future work in this area, and \cref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Prior Work} \label{sec:prior}

There have been a number of studies on the impact of AI code assistants on security. \Citeauthor{nyuuserstudy} \cite{nyuuserstudy} ran a medium-scale ($N = 58$) user study comparing the coding performance of assisted and unassisted student programmers, finding only a ``small'' security impact. Their work differs from my approach by focusing on lower-level concerns like out-of-bounds memory accesses.

On the other hand, a more recent user study from \citeauthor{labstudypub} \cite{labstudypub} found that participants assisted by Codex wrote ``significantly less secure code'' than the control group. They asked experiment participants ($N = 47$) to write code in a greater variety of tasks, and found that the AI-assisted group performed worse across four of five tasks. Interestingly, they also found that the more the programmer edited the synthesized code or engaged with the AI model by tweaking prompts or parameters, the more likely it is to be secure. However, since their focus is on comparing the performance of assisted and unassisted groups, they did not include any tasks that are insecure by design.

A significant amount of work has also gone into detecting and remediating security bugs. Fast rules-based code scanners such as Sem\-grep \cite{semgrep}, CodeQL \cite{codeql, gh-codescanning}, and code linters are widely deployed in industry, as are heavy-duty static analysis solutions like Coverity \cite{coverity} and Clang Analyzer. Emerging ML-based approaches such as Merly Mentor \cite{merly-mentor} can also detect security-relevant code anomalies. The adjacent field of bug remediation is a bit sparser. Sem\-grep Autofix and Mentor often offer suggestions for issues that they uncovered. \Citeauthor{llm-repairs} \cite{llm-repairs} investigated using LLMs themselves to repair security bugs.

\section{Security Model} \label{sec:model}

Software security as a field encompasses a large number of topics and practices. While plenty of security bugs have resulted from traditional code writing approaches, code assistants represent an additional source of vulnerabilities. Conversely, if the programmer's \emph{prompt} to the code assistant system contains a faulty design or a vulnerable assumption, it is impossible for a faithful code assistant to ever generate safe code. This justifies the importance of attributing the \emph{source} of the bug to either the human developer or the code assistant.\footnote{I would note that the source of a bug is not necessarily a strict dichotomy: it can be a mix of unclear instruction from the developer and misunderstanding by the code assistant.}

Concretely, we will use the following categorization of vulnerabilities:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{\textbf{Implementation errors}} describe bugs that are almost solely an artifact of the code assistant system, where it explicitly fails to implement part of the prompt.
    \item \emph{\textbf{Decision errors}} represent an intermediate class of bugs. The developer's prompt is reasonably clear and contains no insecure assumptions, but the code assistant \emph{chooses} an insecure implementation when a secure one exists.
    \item \emph{\textbf{Design errors}} describe bugs that are necessary results of the developer's faulty specification.
\end{enumerate}
Among these, implementation errors are the most detectable and hence the most benign, since the developer can easily notice that the code doesn't do the job as requested. This work focuses on the latter two.

Regarding design errors, one may argue that the job of a code assistant is to always strive to carry out the programmer's instructions. However, the \emph{effect} of a design error is often no different from that of an implementation error. Broken ciphers, even if perfectly implemented, are just as insecure as an incorrect implementation of a strong cipher. A MP system that aspires to be secure must strive to reject insecure demands (but perhaps offer an override switch if needed).

Additionally, security bugs take on many shapes. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database \cite{cwe} documents almost one thousand kinds of weaknesses, each of which could contribute to a lapse in security. In this study, we will focus on two common types of failure modes commonly seen in web applications:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Code Injection:}} Examples include cross-site scripting (XSS) in HTML.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Cryptographic Failures:}} Examples include old or weak ciphers, or insecure modes of operation (e.g., electronic codebook (ECB) and unauthenticated modes).
\end{enumerate}
Due to the prevalence of web applications, these two problems are significant challenges facing the security industry. They rank highly in industry-compiled lists on most dangerous security risks: code injection is \#3 on 2021 OWASP Top Ten \cite{owasp-top10} and \#2 of the 2022 CWE Top 25 \cite{cwe-top25}; cryptographic failure is \#2 on 2021 OWASP Top Ten \cite{owasp-top10}.

\section{Security Evaluation} \label{sec:eval}

In this section, we evaluate the security of code synthesized by two state-of-the-art code LLMs: Amazon Code\-Whis\-per\-er and Open\-AI Codex. Codex is the underlying LLM model used in the commercial Git\-Hub Copilot service \cite{copilot-announce}.

\subsection{Methods}

I first prepared a set of prompts that describe tasks that relate to either creating HTML code from variables, or using cryptography in some manner. I then passed the prompts to each of the two models, and evaluated the result by manual inspection. If the code appears non-functional or unsafe, I additionally assigned one of the categories described in \cref{sec:model} to describe the error as in the implementation, decision, or design. I then provided increasingly more detail in the prompt until the model either returns a correct implementation that is also free of obvious security issues, or the prompt is as specific as I can possibly make it. All prompt used in this investigation is included in \cref{app:prompts}.

\paragraph{Source of prompts.}
Part of the difficulty in evaluating the security of assistant services is in obtaining useful prompts.
The focus of this project is on evaluating code assistants in a production-like software engineering environment. As such, I drew upon the experience of student software engineering projects I was part of, to create prompts that I would probably have written at the time. Two of the projects were web applications that accept user registrations; one is a tax preparation application that additionally encrypted user's Social Security numbers before storing it into a database. As such, I am particularly interested in web application security (e.g., potential for injection attacks like XSS and SQL injection) and the use of cryptography.

There are two clear downsides to this approach:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There can be inherent biases, since in I am both the prompt writer and the author of this report.
    \item The number of prompts that can be evaluated this way is limited.
\end{enumerate}
But in comparison to the disadvantages of using an alternative dataset discussed below, I believe the downsides are acceptable.

\paragraph{Alternative datasets considered.}
I first considered three existing sources of prompts, but none of them works well for this report:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Open-source code bases.} Extracting code comments (Python docstrings, Java and Go doc comments) from existing large open-source projects appears to be ideal. But given many assistant models are trained on public codebases such as Git\-Hub repositories \cite{Chen2021EvaluatingLL}, it's highly likely that the models have already seen these prompts.

    \item \textbf{Coding puzzles.} Datasets like Open\-AI's Human\-Eval dataset \cite{openai-humaneval} and Google Code\-Jam contest entries have been used in past evaluations of code assistants. However, they are typically simplistic and self-contained, and do not replicate the conditions and complexities of a full software engineering project.
    
    \item \textbf{CONCODE dataset.} The CONCODE dataset \cite{concode}, part of Microsoft's Code\-XGLUE \cite{ms-codexglue}, incorporates both a natural-language query and context about the surrounding class. But it is also gathered from public codebases, which suffers the same problem as using existing open-source projects. (Indeed, searching some of the CONCODE examples on Git\-Hub directly reveals where an example came from.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
I have created a few prompts, passed them to Open\-AI's Codex model and Amazon Code\-Whis\-per\-er. For Codex, I specifically used the \textsf{code-\allowbreak{}da\-vinci-\allowbreak{}002} model (the most capable model in the Codex series). The temperature is set to 0.1 as recommended by Codex's documentation, while all other parameters are the default values. For Code\-Whis\-per\-er, I used its official Visual Studio Code extension. The result is summarized in \cref{tab:eval}, and representative unsafe code is provided in \cref{fig:examples}.

The code synthesized by both models is broadly insecure for a wide variety of tasks. While I specifically chose tasks with security implications, most of the output was insecure in some significant way. For example, when asked to write a function to return an HTML page with certain string variables, the models uses string concatenation or string formatting functions and do not escape strings, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (\cref{fig:go-xss-misuse}). To a junior developer who is not aware of XSS attacks in the first place, there is no indication at all that the code may not be secure.

What's more surprising is the fact that even with explicit suggestions to use a more secure approach, the models often either ignores the hint, or misuses it. For instance, when explicitly prompted to start the solution with ``\texttt{return\allowbreak{} tem\-plate.}'' in Go in order to force the use of the secure \texttt{html/tem\-plate} package, the models circumvents the default HTML escape behavior by using the \texttt{tem\-plate.HTML} function. A gentler hint in the form of an import statement is ignored altogether.

Results from the cryptography category was no more convincing. In general, to be secure against a chosen-ciphertext attack, both \emph{confidentiality} and \emph{authenticity} are necessary \cite{cryptobook}. Concretely, one can either combine a confidentiality-only scheme (such as CBC, CFB, or CTR) with a message authentication code (MAC), or use an authenticated-encryption scheme (such as GCM). However, most of the output we find only uses a confidentiality-only scheme. In some cases, the model would output code using electronic codebook mode (ECB), which does not guarantee even confidentiality \cite{cryptobook}.

For both models, only when explicitly prompted to use AES-GCM do they return code that does authenticated encryption. Ironically, one output from Codex that uses CFB even includes a comment asking the user to use authenticated encryption for security -- but does not itself use authenticated encryption (\cref{fig:go-noauth}). It turns out that this particular code output (including the comment) is a verbatim copy of an example in Go's official documentation \cite{go-cipher-test}. Similarly, a JavaScript output for the same problem uses the \texttt{crypto.\allowbreak{}create\-Cipher} function, which according to Node.js documentation is deprecated and ``semantically insecure for all supported ciphers and fatally flawed for ciphers in counter mode,'' as it does not use authentication.

Finally, we find that the two models we used, Codex and Code\-Whis\-per\-er, tend to perform quite similarly in most cases. The security of synthesized code only differs in two cases: Codex is able to produce working code for the last task that uses AES-GCM, whereas Code\-Whis\-per\-er is unable; and Code\-Whis\-per\-er provides no support for Go code, while Codex does.

\subsection{Discussion}

The previous section provides an overview of the evaluation results. However, there are certain patterns in the result that perhaps reveal insights in the limitations of code LLMs overall. The striking similarity of results between Codex and Code\-Whis\-per\-er, trained by different companies with proprietary code and data, seem to indicate that these insights may generalize well to all code LLMs.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{LLMs often take the path of least resistance.} % unable to make sound engineering decisions.
    
        Where there is a choice to be made, LLMs often seek to take the shortest and most simplistic path to fulfill the prompt, which is often not the most secure. Examples include \cref{fig:go-xss-misuse}, where LLMs opt for simple schemes like string concatenation over using a template library or adding calls to an escape function.

    \item \textbf{Good API design also helps code assistants.}

        A well-designed API is easy to use and hard to misuse \cite{java-crypto-bad}. While both aspects obviously benefit human programmers, it should benefit code LLMs as well. Following the previous point, if the correct path \emph{is} the simplest one, then LLMs would likely tend to prefer that.

        A hard-to-misuse API helps LLMs as well. One example is React's \texttt{dan\-ger\-ous\-ly\-Set\-In\-ner\-HTML} attrib\-ute, which provides an escape hatch to rendering HTML code without additional escapes. When this attribute appears in synthesized code, it would be a difficult-to-miss red flag for the supervising developer (as we see in \cref{fig:react-xss}), who could then make the judgement call.

    \item \textbf{LLMs are reluctant to write helper functions or bring in external libraries.}

        Part of this may be the fact that in many languages, it is customary or required to import libraries at the top of the file. Neither Copilot nor Code\-Whis\-per\-er provides UI that does multiple edits across the file. However, this may potentially be tractable as Codex supports Editing operations. Existing rules-based autocompletion found in IDEs often include automatic import functionality, which sets precedents for an AI model doing the same.

    \item \textbf{LLMs have limited knowledge of best practice in highly specialized fields.}

        In fields like cryptography, the security properties are often quite subtle. A computer science student who has not taken a course in security or cryptography is likely unaware of the differences between confidentiality-only schemes and authenticated encryption. The irony is that if I directly ask GPT-3 ``Is CBC more or less secure than GCM?'' it provides the correct answer. But it does not actually apply its own advice to coding, thus demonstrating a lack of true understanding. 
\end{enumerate}

% - Systems are not innovative. Reluctance to bringing in external libs
%   - Part of this is the fact that imports are usually at the top of the file
%     - Codex has no Edit support but other models do
%     - Similarity with auto-imports?
% - Systems have no knowledge of best practice in highly specialized fields
%   - In cryptography, what most people do ≠ what is secure
% - API design is important for MP as well

\section{Improving Outcome} \label{sec:improve}

In the second half of this paper, I present \emph{Anteater}, a scheme to improve the \emph{outcome} of using code assistants. Note that this differs from merely rewriting the synthesized code, since programs can be made more secure before the actual synthesis step. In the case of design errors, it's actually impossible to rewrite the code to be secure, since the \emph{task} is insecure. I implemented Anteater for Python, which concretely improves the outcomes of prompts used in the previous section.

Anteater uses a few interlocking techniques. These include both MP-specific strategies like Input Preprocessing, which works on the developer-supplied prompt, as well as more traditional methods like rewrites that also apply to human-written code. A core tenet of Anteater is to not be ``too clever'': it actively keeps the human developer in the loop to better understand the program intention and make judgement calls.

See \cref{fig:outcome} for an overview of how these techniques work together.

\subsection{Input Preprocessing}

AI-driven programming assistant models depend on a natural language prompt to generate relevant code. Moreover, as mentioned in the previous section, models tend to go with the simplest thing that accomplishes the prompt. In such cases, it is often beneficial to first try to understand what the prompt is actually asking for, and flag badly designed prompts.

Anteater uses Open\-AI's GPT-3 for natural language understanding (\cref{fig:ip-gpt}). If the prompt appears to be asking for a function that creates HTML code, Anteater additionally scans the prompt to ensure that the prompt is adequate (e.g., if it includes names of popular template engines). If the prompt appears to be asking for a function that does encryption, Anteater instead checks whether the prompt mentions the cipher to be used anywhere. This could easily be extended as more security-relevant prompts are identified.

If an insufficient prompt is identified, Anteater asks the developer to strengthen the prompt by including additional details (\cref{fig:ip-msg}). The developer is also free to override the decision.

\caption{Semgrep rule detecting potential XSS vulnerabilities in Python.}
\label{lst:semgrep}
\end{listing}

Despite Anteater's best attempts at flagging queries, it is likely impossible to completely avoid bad code from being generated. As a backstop mechanism, Anteater integrates Semgrep \cite{semgrep}, a rules-based code scanner widely used in industry, to further flag suspicious output. In addition to built-in rules, Anteater also includes some bespoke rules that add support for detecting XSS in Python-specific features like f-strings (example in \hyperref[lst:semgrep]{listing 1}). As future work, additional rules-based and emerging ML-based solutions such as CodeQL and Merly Mentor can also be integrated \cite{codeql, merly-mentor}.

Though such rules-based scanners often have high false positive rates, one may argue that model-synthesized code requires a higher level of scrutiny compared to human-written code. Developers may also have higher tolerance for false positives, as the synthesized code would be new to them as well.

\subsection{Rules-based Output Rewriting}

If anomalies were detected during output scanning, Anteater would attempt to directly rewrite the synthesized output to remove the bugs. To do so, Anteater utilizes Semgrep's Autofix feature, which fixes many security bugs in a fully automated and relatively accurate way. The bespoke Semgrep rules that I introduced also support autofix.

\subsection{Discussion}

Using these techniques, Anteater is able to fully prevent XSS bugs from appearing with the ``return HTML page with given variables'' prompt, when used with Codex. It does so in two different ways: first, by enforcing a sufficiently complete prompt going \emph{into} the model; and second, even if the programmer overrides the preprocessing step, output rewriting will neutralize the XSS vector. Similarly, it also prevents underspecified prompts related to encryption from being passed into the model.

One critique with the input preprocessing stage may be that hardcoding categories of security-sensitive prompts does not scale. However, there are only a finite number of known security risks. Efforts such as Semgrep rely largely on manually written rule sets (which also does not scale well), but still manage to be widely adopted and adequate in most cases.

\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future}

It is clear that much remains in way of better understanding the limitations of LLM-based code assistants, especially as it relates to the security of synthesized code. Prior work often relied on user research \cite{nyuuserstudy,labstudypub} and analysis of programmer behavior to evaluate security. But the ideal code assistant should aim to \emph{never generate insecure code.}

There is also much that can be done in the field of outcome improvement. One potential line of research is automatically rewriting the natural language input to be safer. One evaluation of Codex \cite{smitop} noticed that by default, Codex generated code with SQL injection vulnerability in response to \emph{``Insert \$name into the people table.''} However, after appending \emph{``safely''} to the prompt, Codex generated a SQL-based query free from injections. Another is making use of more powerful LLMs, such as the recently announced ChatGPT \cite{chatgpt}, to provide a more interactive experience in understanding what the developer wants.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this report, I evaluated the security of code synthesized by two state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly by focusing on the possibility of code injection attacks and the use of cryptographic primitives. I found that without prompt engineering, LLMs often take the path of least resistance in implementing the prompts, which often lead to insecure code. However, by specifying additional constraints in the prompt

Additionally, I introduced \emph{Anteater}, a series of techniques that provide user-centric outcome improvement. Anteater flags natural-language prompts that may potentially lead to security bugs, and does so by leveraging a LLM for natural-language understanding. Anteater also attempts to flag or rewrite the synthesized code to improve security.
